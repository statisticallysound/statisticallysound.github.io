Hey there! I'm Amos, a senior at Fremont High School.

*statisticallysound* is a blog that I started to showcase my statistics projects. As the name suggests, my goal is to analyze data and reach meaningful insights with a "statistically sound" methodology and mindset. Stay tuned for more *statisticallysound* content!

# FAQ

### What software do you use?

I use Microsoft Excel, Python, and R to wrangle and analyze the data, and Adobe Photoshop to clean up the visualizations.

### Do you take suggestions?

Absolutely! Don't hesitate to direct message me on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/statisticallysound/). Always open to feedback, topic suggestions, and intriguing data sources. I'm happy to fulfill topic requests if I can find appropriate data on the subject.

### Where do you find the data?

Google has been my best friend! In some projects, I've had to web scrape my own data (eg. Jeopardy Daily Doubles), and other times public data is available, just requires some digging and investigation to find the data.
